Petty cash provides convenience for small transactions for which issuing a check or a corporate credit card is unreasonable or unacceptable. The small amount of cash that a company considers petty will vary, with many companies keeping between $100 and $500 as a petty cash fund. Examples of transactions that a petty cash fund is used for include:

Office supplies
Cards for customers
Flowers
Paying for a catered lunch for a small group of employees
Reimbursing an employee for small work-related expenses
